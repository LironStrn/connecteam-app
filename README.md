One of the most interesting decisions I made was choosing Tailwind CSS for styling and ensuring a responsive design. Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed me to build the landing page rapidly while maintaining a clean and readable codebase. Its built-in responsive design features made it easy to create a mobile-first layout, ensuring that the page adapted seamlessly to different screen sizes. This decision was crucial for speeding up development, maintaining design consistency, and providing an optimized user experience across devices. Tailwind's flexibility allowed me to make quick adjustments and ensure the design aligned with the original vision efficiently.
